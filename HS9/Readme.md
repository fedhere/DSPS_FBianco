1. Remake a plot that we made for this class before, but improve it according to the standards established in the lecture on visualization. Put the notebook in your #HW9 folder on github and the plot in the README of that channel. Explain what you changed and why.
2. Post the good and bad visualizations that you found in the literature and had posted to slack in the README of your HW9 folder on github and explain what they show, makes them good and what makes them bad. Explicitly say what you would change to improve the bad one (or both if you want)
