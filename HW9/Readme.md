Due 11/10 at 11:59:59

Select two visualizations from the scientific literature, a "good" one and a "bad" one, according to the standards established in the lecture on visualizations. 
Please use only published papers and stay away from papers you are a coauthor of. This is because I want you to engage critically with the literature and because discussing and criticizing a plot made by a UD research group would put me in a difficult position. 
You can browse papers on the arxiv.org for free and on many scientific publication venues like Nature and Science whe you log into the UD library.
Post them on slack in the channel #visualizations https://dspsudel.slack.com/archives/C09R5ED9W8K

1. Remake a plot that we made for this class before, but improve it according to the standards established in the lecture on visualization. Put the notebook in your #HW9 folder on github and the plot in the README of that channel. Explain what you changed and why.
2. Post the good and bad visualizations that you found in the literature and had posted to slack in the README of your HW9 folder on github and explain what they show, makes them good and what makes them bad. Explicitly say what you would change to improve the bad one (or both if you want)
