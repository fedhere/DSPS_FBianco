# READING: 
Read the Corral 2018 paper that you are reproducing in the homework assignment: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.0055.pdf
You do not need to read the paper in all details, I am not trying to turn you into a sismologist, but you do need to read and understand the key steps of the analysis to be able to reproduce them.

# VIEWING: 
view the TED talk by Goeffrey Wes on scaling laws in urban science
