# 1. Uncerainties and Dark Matter 

follow the instructions in the notebook [MWrotCurve_instructions.ipynb](MWrotCurve_instructions.ipynb). You are reproducing the work in https://academic.oup.com/pasj/article/67/4/75/1536635. The goal is to assess whether different treatment of uncertainties leads to different conclusions about the presence of dark matter in a galaxy based on the rotational curves of the stars within

The uncertainties in the original paper are treated as described in this paragraph

Problem on MCMC and estimation of uncertainties (TBD)

Problem 2 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf). Most of the stuff you need to do it is in the Pi lab we did in class (e.g. the "isin" function is the same scheme you will use to reject proposals)
