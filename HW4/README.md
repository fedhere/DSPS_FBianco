# 1. Uncerainties and Dark Matter 

follow the instructions in the notebook [MWrotCurve_instructions.ipynb](MWrotCurve_instructions.ipynb). You are reproducing the work in https://academic.oup.com/pasj/article/67/4/75/1536635. The goal is to assess whether different treatment of uncertainties leads to different conclusions about the presence of dark matter in a galaxy based on the rotational curves of the stars within
