Sections 1 through 4 Due 12/3/2025 (will be included in 12/4 quiz), 5-8 Due 12/9

I think this is a really important read so I will definitely quiz you on it!

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Notebook** - follow the instructions in  https://github.com/fedhere/DSPS_FBianco/tree/main/HW11Links to an external site.

NOTE: there are neural networks to train which takes time and resources! do not start at the last time and save/download our intermediate results! (instructions within).

NOTE: if your notebook runs into rendering issues (with the message "There was an error rendering your Notebook: the 'state' key is missing from 'metadata.widgets'. Add 'state' to each, or remove 'metadata.widgets'.") 
look at this solutions (sort of solutions) https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/155944Links to an external site. or ask me

In the last part of the assignment, you will upload your own image and process it with the mode you developed in earlier steps. Upload the resulting image to slack in the HW11 channel

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Plotreview** - On slack you will receive the name of two classmates. _DEADLINE EXTENDED TO 12/11 11:59_

Review the plot they updated as part of their HW9 in the light of the best practices we discussed in this course. Their plot should be visible in their HW9 Readme.
- Write the review as a Markdown file called Review_Lastname.md. **REPLACE Lastname with your last name**! Click on the "Add  file" button on their github.com repository, This will prompt you to "fork" reir repo - say yes
- Include the plot in your readme file.
- Follow the criteria indicated below in your review
- Once you are done save the file and follow the prompts to submit a pull request to your classmate repo
- Accept the pull requests of your classmates for your reviews 
- Also review the plot that your classmate indicated is a "bad" plot.

Include in both your reviews considerations on if the changes improved

- ambiguity
- distortion
- distraction

Is the plot respecting the 5 Tufte’s rules and did the improvement improve on any of them?

- **effect size ~ 1**: The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graph itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented ("lie factor")
- **data/ink >> 1**: Clear, detailed and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graph itself. Label important events in the data
- **no chart junk**: Show data variation, not design variation
- **use small-multiples **if comparisons are to be made In time-series displays of money, deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.
- **avoid redundancy in communication**: The number of information carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data. Graphics must not quote data out of context.

Does the plot respect best color practices and is it color-blind compliant?
